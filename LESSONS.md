# LESSONS: Web Cam Viewer (Mantra)

1. **The camera list has no fixed order inside an app (1.11.2026).** `AVCaptureDevice.DiscoverySession(...).devices`
   came back FaceTime first from the terminal but NDI first in the app, so the window opened on a black virtual camera.
   Sort it yourself: the built-in camera first, then by name.
2. **A selftest must not change what the user chose.** Walking every camera through the menu's own action saved the last
   one as remembered; the test selects directly instead.
3. **The app cannot photograph its own window** without Screen Recording permission; the screenshot is taken from the
   terminal with `screencapture -l <window id>` after a `--quiet` start (no focus taken, MacBook Pro screen).
4. **Continuity Camera needs `NSCameraUseContinuityCameraDeviceType`** in Info.plist, or AVFoundation warns and leaves
   the iPhone out.
